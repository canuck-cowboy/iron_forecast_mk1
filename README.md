### Features

- **Weather Data**: Current temperature, description, and weather icon for any city.
- **Unit Conversion**: Toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit with ease.
- **Mode Switch**: Dark mode for those who prefer the night, light mode for those who like it bright.

### How It Works

1. **Input your city**: Type in any city you want to check the weather for.
2. **Press "Get Weather"**: The app fetches the data, and voilà, you get the weather info right away.
3. **Customize**: Switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit. You can also toggle dark and light mode.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/iron-canuck/iron_forecast.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the app:
    ```
    python ui.py
    ```

### Notes

- The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data, so you'll need an API key. Keep it safe and don't commit it to version control.
